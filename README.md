# SLC-TASK
I am Akshay Chnada UG2K24 @IIITH ECE 
Currently, I am involved in the tasks provided by the SLC ,

Involvement in the tasks provided by the SLC group has allowed me to revisit and enhance my skills in Python, HTML, and CSS. 
I put in my best effort to manage my academics and deadlines while working on these tasks. 
Given more time, I would have presented my work in a more refined and efficient manner.

I hope to continue improving my skills and contribute positively to the SLC Tech Team.
